Deep Learning, Improving CNN Accuracy - Tensorflow

2000 animal images (500 of cats,dogs,fish and lions) are used to train a CNN model using Tensorflow. 

At first a simple model is created which yields 27% accuracy:

By adjusting tenchiques such as:

- Droupout
- Learning Rate
- Changing Optimizer
- Batch Normalization
- Changing number of blocks


By adjusting the abovetechniques the final model yielded 76% accuracy with this small dataset.
