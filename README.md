Deep Learning, Improving CNN Accuracy - Tensorflow

2000 animal images (500 of cats, dogs, fish, and lions) are used to train a CNN model using Tensorflow. 

At first, a simple model is created which yields 27% accuracy:

By adjusting techniques such as:

- Dropout
- Learning Rate
- Changing Optimizer
- Batch Normalization
- Changing the number of blocks


It was possible to yield 76% accuracy by changing values of the above items, which is a huge improvement to the original 27%.
